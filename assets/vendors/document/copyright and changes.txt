The original structure and idea of this project were developed by Sir Federico Zivolo and contributors, Â© 2016 Federico Zivolo. While their foundational work has been invaluable, I @ Umesh Garg have undertaken extensive modifications to both the design and functionality to tailor the software to my specific needs and vision.

One of the most noticeable changes I @Umesh Garg implemented is the addition of dynamic moving bubbles in the background. This feature adds a layer of visual interest and modernity, enhancing the overall user experience by making the interface more engaging and lively. This visual effect required significant customization and creativity to seamlessly integrate into the existing structure.

The button designs have also undergone a complete overhaul. I aimed to improve both their usability and aesthetic appeal by making them more intuitive and visually striking. The new design ensures that buttons are easily identifiable and interactable, contributing to a more user-friendly interface.

Responsiveness was another critical area of focus. I extensively revised the CSS and implemented media queries to ensure that the application performs well on a variety of devices and screen sizes, from smartphones and tablets to desktops. This ensures a consistent and accessible user experience across different platforms.

The container design and structure have been reimagined to provide a cleaner and more intuitive layout. By reorganizing the content and improving the visual hierarchy, users can navigate the application more efficiently. This involved significant changes to the HTML and CSS, optimizing both the appearance and functionality of the containers.

Form elements were another area of major improvement. I redesigned the forms to enhance user interaction and data input efficiency. The new forms are more visually appealing and easier to use, incorporating clear labels, improved spacing, and better alignment. These changes help streamline the user experience, making it simpler and more efficient to enter and manage information.

Beyond these major changes, I have made numerous other tweaks and enhancements throughout the project. These include improvements to animations, transitions, and overall aesthetics, aligning the project more closely with modern design principles and user expectations. Each modification, no matter how small, was made with the goal of enhancing the overall usability and visual appeal of the application.

Collectively, these modifications transform the original project into a significantly more robust, visually appealing, and user-friendly application. While the foundational work by Sir Federico Zivolo and contributors provided a solid base, the extensive changes I have implemented result in a distinct version that better meets contemporary standards and user needs.
